        			<p>This is where the article content goes. This is a test to see how everything aligns and such, hopefully it works out and stuff. I also
        			need to work out how the formatting works, so I can just copy/past the contents of my article that I write in word and work out the
        			tabbing and such.</p>
        			
        			<p>This is another paragraph. It probably got fucked up by the br tag, but I just have to go into the CSS formatting file to fix the
        			spacing and stuff.</p>
        			
        			<p>This is a third paragraph to make sure I have the spacing right again. I think it's gonna work. Now, for the other pages for games and
        			tutorials, I need to set up the space for the content (the games page will depend on the game), and set up information/links beneath
        			that, as well as the title/author/date at the top. It would be cool if I could link to a development blog for the games, and even link to
        			a page for addition programming exercises for the tutorials. That could drum up traffic through youtube, directing audience to my site even
        			if they only watch on youtube.</p>

        				<img id="centimg" src="images/homer.jpg" width="100px" height="100px">
        				This is the caption for the above image.
        			</div>
        			
        			<p>I decided to get rid of the br tags and am now relying on the p tags, which is more conventional and makes more sense with the line
        			<img id="leftimg" src="images/homer.jpg" width="100px" height="100px"><img id="rightimg" src="images/homer.jpg" width="100px" height="100px">
        			breaking and indenting and stuff. I am wondering now if I should be using images. I guess in some cases having a diagram and stuff would be
        			smart, but since I am planning on doing this for real this time, I probably should only use my own images. Incorporating canvases for
        			examples would be really cool to do in cases, though development time would be much longer and I would have to plan much more carefully.
        			I think there are instances where it would be really cool, and people would have to go to the website to get the full experience. Merging
        			games with game analysis, criticism, and education.</p>
